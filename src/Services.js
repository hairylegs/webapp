        <h3 class="ui header">RELOCATING TO NEW YORK</h3>
        <p>
          Moving to Manhattan, but don't know what kind of apartment you should
          look for? Should it be a charming prewar, a snazzy new condo, or a
          cozy brownstone? How about a spectacular loft? And where do you want
          to live - near work, in a happening area, or in a quiet family
          neighborhood? And what can you afford? Don't worry, we're here with
          the answers.
        </p>
        <h3 class="ui header">APARTMENTS: COOP vs CONDO</h3>
        <p>
          There are primarily two kinds of apartments for sale in Manhattan,
          coop and condos. The vast majority (over 80%) are coops, while the
          rest are condos. They have different advantages, and you should choose
          the best one for you.
        </p>
        <h4 class="ui header">I. Coops</h4>
        <p>
          With a cooperative apartment you actually own shares in a corporation
          which gives you a proprietary lease to the apartment. Your monthly
          maintenance charge pays all costs to run the building, your real
          estate taxes, heat, water - everything but electric. Owning a coop can
          be a little restrictive: you must be interviewed and approved to
          purchase, any alterations must be approved by the board, as must any
          sublet and resale. They may or may not take pets. There are usually
          financing restrictions as well; typically a coop will not let you
          finance more than 75%. The plusses are generally a lower price than a
          condo, and control over building tenancy.
        </p>
        <h4 class="ui header">II. Condos </h4>
        <p>
          A condominium is a fee type of ownership, and you actually own the
          four walls of the apartment as well as pay your own real estate taxes.
          Condos are very flexible: you can buy them in any name you want (i.e.
          corporate ownership, etc.), there is a less intrusive application
          process and rarely an interview. The only way a condo can reject a
          sublet or sale is to exercise their right of first refusal by matching
          the sale or rental price. Condos in New York also tend to be newer
          luxury highrises, with fancy finishings such as marble baths, health
          clubs, and roof gardens. So if you want something fancy and new, condo
          is the way to go. However they tend to be considerably more expensive
          than coops (30% or more for equivalent size units.)
        </p>
        <h4 class="ui header">III. Single Family Housing</h4>
        <p>
          Townhouses and Brownstones Large individual townhouses do exist in
          Manhattan. They are generally 3-4 stories high and 17-22 feet wide. A
          typical townhouse is anywhere from 3000-6000 square feet, and will
          often have a private garden. Some are single family homes, and some
          have rental apartments in them that can generate income for the owner.
          Prices start at about $3,000,000 and go upward from there. Yearly real
          estate taxes average 1% of the purchase price.
        </p>
        <h3 class="ui header">APARTMENT STYLES</h3>
        <p>
          There are three basic styles as well as three basic types of
          apartments here. The three main types are Pre-war, Post-war, and New
          Construction; the main styles are Highrises, Brownstones, and Lofts.
        </p>
        <h4 class="ui header">I. Prewar</h4>
        <p>
          Prewar apartments are those built before WW II. These are very
          desirable in Manhattan, because they tend to be built in the prime
          locations and have lots of charm and detail not found in postwars.
          Such elegant detail might include high ceilings, fireplaces, crown
          moldings, patterned hardwood floors, and thick plaster walls. Most
          prewars in the better locations have doormen.
        </p>
        <h4 class="ui header">II. Postwar </h4>
        <p>
          Postwar apartments are those built from1946-1980. They are typically
          large highrise buildings with doormen, underground garages, and often
          have great open city views. These are conventional spaces, with
          studio, one bedroom and two bedroom layouts that don't change much
          from building to building. They feature 8' ceilings, parquet hardwood
          floors, and galley style kitchens. Postwars are the most economical
          option, getting the most space for the least amount of money, and are
          very popular with first time buyers.
        </p>
        <h4 class="ui header">III. New Construction</h4>
        <p>
          Thanks to major tax incentives, there was a swell of new construction
          in Manhattan from 1983-1990 and again from 1996-today. This new
          construction is typically a highrise condominium. Though the 1983-1990
          units may be slightly smaller than their postwar counterparts, they
          tend to offer high-end finishings (marble baths, private
          washer/dryers), and more building amenities (health clubs, pools,
          kid's playrooms). They also feature doormen and garages. As many were
          built close to the rivers that border Manhattan, several boast
          absolutely spectacular views. The newest developments focus primarily
          on larger, family sized apartments on the Upper East or West Side,
          while Tribeca, Soho, and Chelsea boast of dramatic new loft buildings
          with immense apartments by the world's leading architects and
          designers. Selling prices on these stunning homes can range from
          $1,500 to over $3,000 per square foot.
        </p>
        <h4 class="ui header">I. Highrise</h4>
        <p>
          These can be either prewar or postwar, and are typically 12-30
          stories, with a doorman, laundry facility in the basement, and
          sometimes a garage. Other amenities might include a roof garden, bike
          room, and individual storage bins. Newer buldings may have a health
          club. There are highrise buildings throughout the city, but the vast
          concentration is from 14th Street to 96th Street on both the east and
          west side. Larger buildings can be found on the avenues, while
          slightly smaller buildings would be found on the side streets.
        </p>
        <h4 class="ui header">II. Brownstone</h4>
        <p>
          A brownstone is an apartment in a small 3-5 story building. Most
          brownstones were originally designed as single family homes in the
          1800s, and have since been converted to apartments. Though room
          dimensions tend to be a little smaller (particularly the bedrooms),
          and closet space is tight, many adore the charm of their fireplaces,
          fancy moldings, and high ceilings. Ground floor units often feature
          large private gardens. Brownstones are too small to have doormen, but
          do have intercom systems for security. About half have some sort of
          laundry and open storage space in the basement which is shared by all
          owners. Those who prefer quiet spaces, tree lined streets, gardens,
          and privacy love brownstones. Brownstones are located primarily on the
          side streets of the East and West sides, in Greenwich Village and
          Chelsea.
        </p>
        <h4 class="ui header">III. Lofts</h4>
        <p>
          Lofts are residential apartments that were generally created out of
          former commercial buildings and warehouses. Though not in typical
          residential areas, they offer huge unconventional spaces that can be
          individually designed. Starting at about 1000 feet, they can be found
          as big as 5000+ square feet. Originally converted for use by artists,
          more and more executives have moved here to take advantage of the
          space and the close proximity to the financial district. Lofts are
          primarily found in the Soho, Tribeca, and Chelsea areas. They rarely
          have doormen, and the bedrooms are often dark, but they typically have
          soaring ceilings, their own washer/dryers and incredible storage. In
          addition, the last five years has seen a proliferation of high end
          designer lofts built with all the amenities of a typical residential
          building, such as garages, gyms, doormen, and children's play rooms.
        </p>
        <h3 class="ui header">NEIGHBORHOODS</h3>
        <p>
          There are many different neighborhoods in Manhattan, all with a
          distinct flair and history. The best way to see which one you like
          best is to come and spend time here! The following is a brief
          description of some of our most popular neighborhoods.
        </p>
        <h4 class="ui header">I. The Upper East Side</h4>
        <p>
          From 59th Street to 96th Street, bordered by the East River and Fifth
          Avenue, this is one of Manhattan's most popular residential
          neighborhoods. Residential amenities abound, including restaurants,
          shopping, good public schools, and "Museum Mile". Central Park is
          within a few blocks for all residents. Easy transportation to midtown
          and Wall Street via the 4,5, and 6 trains and express buses. Fifth and
          Park Avenues offer some of the most beautiful -- and expensive -- real
          estate in Manhattan, while the more affordable postwars and glamorous
          new construction condominiums can be found side by side from First
          Avenue to Lexington.
        </p>

        <h4 class="ui header">II. Midtown</h4>
        <p>
          From 23rd Street to 59th Street, bordered primarily by First and
          Eighth Avenues, this area has more of a mixed commercial flavor,
          bordering as it does on the Midtown business district. It is well
          liked by those who want to walk to work, or want a little hideaway
          just steps away from theaters, Carnegie Hall, and the Opera. The East
          side is popular as it is convenient to business and the United
          Nations. Prestigious Sutton Place is a Park Avenue-like enclave near
          the East River, while Gramercy Park is a charming square bordered by
          elegant buildings with keys to their own private park.
        </p>

        <h4 class="ui header">III. The Upper West Side</h4>
        <p>
          From 60th Street to 96th Street, bordered by Central Park West and
          Riverside Drive, those who flock to this residential neighborhood love
          its active community life, close proximity to both Central Park and
          Riverside Park, the opera and theater at Lincoln Center, the Museum of
          Natural History, and the overall smaller scale and prewar styling.
          Impressive Central Park West is home to movie stars and power brokers,
          while others love the night life on Columbus Avenue and the shopping
          on Broadway, while others prefer the quiet of West End Avenue and its
          broad sweep of stately buildings. With two different subway lines
          going down Broadway and Central Park West, it can be easier and less
          crowded to commute than on the East Side. The easy access to both
          Riverside Park and Central Park makes it perfect for all those who
          love to run, bike, and rollerblade!).
        </p>

        <h4 class="ui header">IV. Greenwich Village/Chelsea</h4>
        <p>
          Well known as a hotbed of artistic and cultural thought, this active
          area reminds many of Boston, with its collection of smaller brownstone
          buildings and cobblestone streets.
        </p>

        <p>
          Hip stores and quaint restaurants rule here. While the area near NYU
          in the central village hums all night long, those seeking quiet charm
          go west of Seventh Avenue to stroll amidst landmark townhouses on
          quaint treelined streets. Chelsea is one of the city's hottest areas,
          due in part to its worldclass Sports and Film complex on the Piers,
          and its mix of small brownstones and huge lofts attracts a wide
          variety of Manhattanites.
        </p>

        <h4 class="ui header">V. SOHO and Tribeca</h4>
        <p>
          Soho ("South of Houston") and Tribeca ("Triangle Below Canal") are
          generally industrial areas, but over the last thirty years they have
          become extremely popular with those seeking oversized loft homes.
          Originally settled by artists seeking large studios, many of the
          wonderful old cast iron warehouses and factories have been gut
          renovated to create some spectacular residences. Some buildings
          maintain the restriction "artists only", but by and large those
          restrictions have eased and anyone can live here. Nearer to Wall
          Street and the financial district, it makes an interesting alternative
          to the more conservative Upper East Side. Soho is renowned for its
          spectacular upscale and trendy shopping, while Tribeca now hosts some
          of the world's finest restaurants.
        </p>

        <h4 class="ui header">VI. Upper Manhattan</h4>
        <p>
          Upper Manhattan begins with Harlem (125th Street) and stretches all
          the way up to the northern tip of the island, where neighborhoods
          including Hamilton Heights, Audubon Terrace, Washington Heights,
          Hudson Heights, and Inwood have all found their way into the
          mainstream of New York Real Estate. Harlem is known for its
          brownstones and rich history; the Heights and Inwood have become
          housing destinations for families, professionals, artists and
          academics priced out of the downtown neighborhoods or simply looking
          for a little more nature and a little less bustle. Easily accessible
          by A Train Express and local 1 and 9 subway lines, these cozy
          neighborhoods feature pockets of real New York history, beauty and
          nature including the Apollo Theatre, the Cloisters Museum in Fort
          Tryon Park, and Inwood Hill Park. The predominant architecture of
          gracious pre-war and Art Deco co-ops make Upper Manhattan the perfect
          choice for those who want to live large at a reasonable price.

          New York City's Rental and Property Management Specialists
        </h4>

        <p>
          For over 25 years, Olshan Realty has been New York City's leading
          relocation broker. Olshan, a 5 Star Award/Circle of Excellence winner,
          has been the Cartus agent in Manhattan since 1981. During that time we
          have successfully overseen thousands of corporate relocations and home
          sales, and have been instrumental in group moves for such firms as
          Mobil, JC Penney, and Citicorp.
        </p>

        <p>
          By special request, we assumed responsibilities of rental property
          management for our corporate clients in 1994. Taking over from a firm
          that had neglected all management for months, Olshan quickly
          established order. In fact, some of those same rentals are still with
          us today. Olshan's property management division has continued to grow.
          We oversee both corporate and individual properties, and have
          successfully coordinated incoming group moves from 1 to 60 renters,
          for such firms as Sony and Verizon.
        </p>

        <h4 class="ui header">GREAT NEWS FOR INVESTORS!</h4>

        <p>
          Individual investors can now take advantage of Olshan's Fortune 500

          New York City condos have soundly outperformed the stock market for
          over a decade, offering strong double digit capital appreciation while
          obtaining high rents. This makes owning a Manhattan home the perfect
          choice for savvy investors seeking to diversify their Wealth
          Management portfolios, as well as foreign buyers taking advantage of
          the currency market.
